# Magic: The Gathering Management

Originally this project was created to collate data for Momir Vig, a Magic: The Gathering format, and collate other about MTG cards from MTGJSON.

Given a collection of MTG Cards, this project is designed to filter the cards to a desired list and print them by set in a formatted inDesign document
